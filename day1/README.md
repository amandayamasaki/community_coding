# COMMUNITY CODING DAY 1
### Introduction to HTML & CSS.

***

#### VOCABULARY

HTML / Div Tags 
```
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is not actually a programming a language, but rather the structure of the web page.
<div> tags define a division or section of an HTML document.  
There are different tags for different uses, for instance an <a> tag is used for links.  
All <div> tags need a closing </div> tag. You can nest a <div> in a <div>.
```

```HTML
<div>
	Text in my div
	<div> more text in my div </div>
</div>
```

CSS / IDs and Classes
```
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the styles for the structure of the web page.
They have different selectors called Classes and Ids - Classes are selected by . and IDs by #
```

```CSS
.myClass{ 
	sample:style; 
}

#myClass{ 
	sample:style; 
}
```
