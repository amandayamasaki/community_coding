        			<p><b>Women in Tech Spotlight: Brenda Wilkerson</b>
        				<span>Brenda believes in the importance of early computer science education because she wishes that she could have been exposed to programming at an earlier age. Informed by her own experiences, she spearheaded the original Computer Science for All Initiative in Chicago Public Schools for all 400,000 students. She currently serves as the President and CEO for AnitaB.org, an organization promoting 50/50 gender diversity for technology in sectors such as academia, industry, and government.</span>
