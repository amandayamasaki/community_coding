        <font size= "6"> Our Program </font><br>
This program is called Community Coding by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago held in Homan Square (North Lawndale<br> Community).
        In these 2 weeks, we learned the basics of creating websites by practicing with HTML and CSS. 
        We also had many <br>
        discussions on how technology impacts and influences the community. 
        Our goal is to use technology to change how the rest of Chicago<br>views the West Side. 
        We wanted to create a website for the community where people can have access to events, resources, and information about what goes on in North Lawndale.
        We hope to give the community a voice to show that there are many positive things and wonderful opportunities not just in North Lawndale, but the whole West Side.<br>

<br>T.R.A.C.E is a program run by the Chicago Park District. They meet in Hamilton Park on the South Side of Chicago in Englewood. <br>
        This organization brings South Side teens together as creative artists and educators. 
        These “TRACErs” collaborate with the community <br> to design and compose art.
        To celebrate their 10th anniversary, they have designed a mural on 58th and Halsted. This is to celebrate 
        the<br> work they’ve accomplished over the past decade, and also recognize their  supporters and celebrate all past, 
        present, and future Tracers. <br>Lawndale Coding collaborated with them by making a QR code to send the viewers to information about the
        figures in their mural.
