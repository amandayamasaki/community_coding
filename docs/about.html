				<h4 style="text-align: left">About the Course</h4>
     			<p>This program is called Community Coding by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago held in Homan Square (North Lawndale Community). In these 2 weeks, we learned the basics of creating websites by practicing with HTML and CSS. We also had many discussions on how technology impacts and influences the community. Our goal is to use technology to change how the rest of Chicago views the West Side. We wanted to create a website for the community where people can have access to events, resources, and information about what goes on in North Lawndale. We hope to give the community a voice to show that there are many positive things and wonderful opportunities not just in North Lawndale, but the whole West Side. </p>

     			<h4 style="text-align: left">About North Lawndale</h4>
				<p>North Lawndale is located on the westside of Chicago. The predominantly black neighborhood contains 35,276 people (2015). In 1890, the area was heavily populated by Bohemian and Czech immigrants who lived in the popular architecture of greystone buildings. By the 1950s, blacks resided in North Lawndale after coming from the southside of Chicago and southern states. In 1966, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. lived at 1550 S. Hamlin Ave while campaigning against housing discrimination, which was once common in Chicago. After Kingâ€™s death, there were many riots in the 60s followed by high unemployment and crime rates. North Lawndale is home to the original Sears tower, now called the Nichols Tower, and the Homan Square Community Center.
