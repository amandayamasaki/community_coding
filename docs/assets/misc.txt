<font size= "6"> Our Program </font>
        <br>
		This program is called Community Coding by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago held in Homan Square (North Lawndale Community).
        In these 2 weeks, we learned the basics of creating websites by practicing with HTML and CSS. 
        We also had many discussions on how technology impacts and influences the community. 
        Our goal is to use technology to change how the rest of Chicago<br>views the West Side. 
        We wanted to create a website for the community where people can have access to events, resources, and information about what goes on in North Lawndale.
        We hope to give the community a voice to show that there are many positive things and wonderful opportunities not just in North Lawndale, but the whole West Side.<br>
