# COMMUNITY CODING

***


## 8.6.18 : Day 1

#### Summary 

We began learning about coding Starting with the [About Me](./../1_lesson) website activity. Students personalized the websites via an introduction to html, css, tags, etc in order to adjust text and images.

In the afternoon Haman took us on a tour of the tower (2nd floor, 14th floor) and the community center (family first, garden cafe, blumen) making connections to the morning/online to the real world talking about narratives, how we access information, who creates that content, what might we want to influence stories about us and our communities.

## 8.7.18 : Day 2

#### Summary 

This morning, Amanda answered questions relating to yesterday's lesson in html and css (how to center, resize or move an image, how to scroll, how to add more body text, how to insert a GIF.) Amanda continued into the [Lesson 2](./../2_lesson) songwriting activity (an introduction to javascript), how it works to make the computer do an action for you by creating a formula with variables. Students followed her notes on the computer and then paired up for an exercise (whereas yesterday folks worked individually) 

This afternoon Haman led a discussion asking about the morning and making connections to opportunities as a result of coding, communication as a potential for connection as well as conflict, information and sources. We played a game of broken telephone to demonstrate the difficulties of sharing messages. The group split into trios to play 2 truths and a lie then we talked bout how we believe what we believe and sources we trust/why. Later we watched a short video on communication to further our reflection on information dissemination, motivations/outcomes. We closed with a video about an artist who came to fame using wheat paste to introduce the class to our upcoming project.

## 8.8.18 : Day 3

#### Summary 

In the morning, Amanda introduced three more additional concepts (strings, integers, booleans) and a final project that combined the previous days' lessons (html, css and javascript) : the self care ritual app, [Lesson 3](./../3_lesson). Students brainstormed about self care, ritual, considered daily vs. one off, the conversation was practical - drink water, get sleep, eat a fruit, journal, boundaries with friends.

In the afternoon, we went on a fieldtrip to TRACE so both groups could get to know each other, their projects and potential ways to collaborate. Haman led a conversation around narratives, the stories we hear, what we experience personally, how can we interrupt stereotypes about us and our communities. Students from the south shared what they'd heard about the west and vice versa. Highlights were check ins/outs and games.

## 8.9.18 : Day 4

#### Summary 

Amanda gave a lesson about hacking, sniffing packages and reviewed everything we've done coding-wise and offered two new concepts : scope and loop. Students continued to work on their about me pages and self care apps.

In the afternoon Haman described the dimensions of the boards that we are going to post on and walked us to the site so we can imagine a configuration. We brainstormed whether to make them a train or a house in order to give each student a window inside a larger context - we settled on windows in grey stones with the theme "What's good North Lawndale" - 4 windows across 3 boards and began working on photo collage images in photoshop. We strategized marketing possibilities for the final event; Haman suggested each student invite 5 friends/family as the most effective way to get folks to come.

## 8.10.18 : Day 5

#### Summary 

In the morning we did the new check in that we practiced yesterday with images as well as a call and response (student closes their check in with I'm Here, the class responds OK! - this is modeled after TRACE I'm in, Axe!) Teresa gave a short photoshop intro to support the students' digital drawing projects for the pop up mural answering Qs from yesterday afternoon. Amanda gave an additional overview of functions and recursion that relates back to the self care app, students tried inspecting the code on any website and then their self care website. Amanda offered an optional challenge. 

In the afternoon I showed a couple examples of collage artists while Haman cut boards for each student to make a personal board - this is in addition to the digital image for the group project. They worked on collage, printing images.

## 8.13.18 : Day 6

#### Summary 

This morning the class completed the I am/I will image/text check in + reflection. Afterwards Amanda presented an organization system for project management to break down remaining tasks for the week. The class split into two groups, one focused on the website connected to the pop up mural and the other focused on the mural itself.

## 8.14.18 : Day 7

#### Summary 

In the morning the students completed their images to upload to the drive (all of them are in!) and finalized their about me pages as well as look at the project management board to move the to-do post-its over to doing and over to done - I saw students taking ownership of tasks and making new post-its as needed - the grid looks entirely different today than yesterday! 

In the afternoon, the students received a call from Marcus at TRACE explaining the cancellation and apologizing to persuade the students to come on Thursday - we will :) I think the call was essential. In the afternoon, we had a guest, artist and Westside local Alexandria Eregbu. She spoke about her practice as it relates to narratives and storytelling through mixed media. Students completed their whet paste personal boards to learn the technique we will use on the community board on Friday morning.

## 8.15.18 : Day 8

#### Summary 

After check-in the students caught Amanda and Teresa up on yesterday afternoon's call with Marcus, guest artist, completing personal wheat paste boards and typing content for the collective site. Students spent the morning in groups working on pages for the website within the framework she built, adding the text they typed yesterday. Amanda shared traditional Chinese Moon pies which provided an opportunity to talk about preferences and tolerance.

In the afternoon the students caught Haman up on the morning's activities. We discussed going to TRACE tomorrow, there's still some resistance but I think in the end, we will all go fingers crossed. Haman drilled legs on personal boards and the students painted them. Students printed positive images for the boards that will appear under the pop up mural and prepared them to wheat paste tomorrow.

## 8.16.18 : Day 9

#### Summary 

After check in the student wrapped up their projects either coding or wheat pasting. Amanda reviewed with students all the resources online (forever) they can use connected to this course, the coding challenges for ex. (two additional exercises they can do own their own incl. a bus tracker app.), shared coding job posting pages, reminded them about opportunities available via coding that don't require a 4yr degree and gave them time to look up a few jobs to read descriptions and explain.

In the afternoon we went to TRACE's mural unveiling which to wheatpaste two QR codes and celebrate with them at their barbecue. Students walked the trail, made buttons, played football, displayed their personal wheatpaste boards, collected garbage, contributed to the mural and it felt like even the folks who hadn't wanted to come had a great time despite the heat even! It was great for the participants to see in action an exemplary community function with food, music, activities and more, to see the community come out, honk their horns as their drove by and feel what is possible when you engage the community through art!

## 8.17.18 : Day 10

#### Summary 

Today students presented their websites and personal boards at Homan and their collective community pop up murals at Filmore and Kedzie. The kids worked together to finish everything in time for public presentation to invitees, fiends and family at 3pm - they also received their cheques at this celebratory pizza party. Amanda described the program, Alyssa talked everyone through the website then at the site Haman talked about the student's intentions to change the narrative and students chimed in about their experience with TRACE, murals and relating coding to how we become storytellers about our own experiences and communities. The kids held up the HONK 4 CHANGE signs and drivers responded super positively - it was super sweet to see the exchange.
